Some useful Linux-based utilities...

Useful for setting a stopwatch/timeout function for keeping track of time.

##VGA Switch
VGA Switch is a small utility for utilizing the Linux Kernel's `vga_switcheroo` capabilities on MUXed laptops with a Discrete and Integrated Graphics Processor. 

##Minecraft Installation
Seeing as there was no general installation utility for Minecraft, this script serves such a purpose for the Linux Minecraft user's dilemma.

##GTKSourceView Code
Just some general language and theme files, for better support.
